# Workshop02 : Class object creation/initialization and Palindrome algorithim implementation

## Objective
* Familiar with creating and initializing Class
* Develop a *Stack* class using *character array* 
* Input value into the program using *Scanner* class and validate input
* Implement *palindrome* algorithm

## Outline
* When the user enters input value, the program validates input as follows.

* When the user input is validated, the program create stack object and initialize it with 1 argument which is the length of user input
* The program pushes user input to a stack array as follows.

* The program checks the user input String(Word) is palindrome or not

* Print the proper message based on if the input is palindrome or not
