# Java
Java is a widely-used, class-based, object-oriented programming environment. 
Its appeal comes from platform independence, programming convenience, and a rich and vibrant ecosystem. 
This subject serves as a thorough introduction to Java as an object-oriented and functional programming language. 
Topics include object-oriented concepts, lambda expressions, functional interfaces, threads, exceptions, graphical user interface programming with Java FX, input / output, networking, client-server programming, servlets, and database access via JDBC.

#### Classes and Objects
* primitive types and references to objects
* programming with types and packages
* generics and annotations

#### Interface, Nested Classes, Functional Concepts
* working with interface
* static nested classes
* inner classes 
* anonymous inner classes
* lambda expressions
* functional interfaces

#### Exceptions
* exception handlers, transfer of control
* asynchronous exceptions
* try, catch, finally blocks

#### Threads
* creating threads using Thread class/Runnable interface
* synchronization design, wait / notify
* thread scheduling, management and thread group

#### Standard Java Packages
* java.io - Input/Output Stream, Reader/Writer and serialization
