# LinkedList
>* Array stores data in continuous memory cells.
>* LinkedList stores data in non-continuous memory cells called `node`.
>* Each node stores both data value and next node's memory address.
>* The code dealing with Linked list should know where the first node starts.
>* Linkedlist is better than array in that it can store data in non-continous memories.
>* For example, when deleting data in array, all of the adjacent cells should be moved at one step. However, linkedlist just need to change the link to the next node, so the deleting complexity is lower than array
