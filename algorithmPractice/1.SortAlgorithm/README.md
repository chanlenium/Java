# Bubble sort :
>* Comparing neighboring data, sending and sorting the largest data to the back.
>* Worst complexity: n^2
>* Average complexity: n^2
>* Best complexity: n
>* Space complexity: 1

# Selection Sort
>* Find the minimum value among the given lists. The value is replaced with the first value (pass).
>* Except for the first location, change the list in the same way.
>* Worst complexity: n^2
>* Average complexity: n^2
>* Best complexity: n^2
>* Space complexity: 1

# InsertionSort
>* Starting with the second element(arr[i]), specifies a position to insert compared to the elements on the left, then moves the element back and inserts the data into the designated position.
>* Worst complexity: n^2
>* Average complexity: n^2
